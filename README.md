# Project Title

This repository contains the code and resources used to analyze Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) to gain insights into their performance and market trends.

## Problem Statement

This project aims to analyze the performance of BEVs and PHEVs in the US market. The goal is to understand market trends, identify factors influencing consumer choices, and explore the potential for clean energy adoption.
## Overview of the Dashboard

- Project aims to conduct Comparison between fuel economy between BEVs, PHEVs, and conventional gasoline vehicles

- Factors influencing electric and hybrid vehicle range, such as engine size and drivetrain configuration.
 
- Eligibility for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives based on tailpipe emissions.

## Insights


- Electric vehicles achieve an average of 120 MPGe (miles per gallon equivalent) in city driving conditions, significantly higher than conventional gasoline vehicles.
- Certain BEV models can travel over 300 miles on a single charge, addressing range anxiety concerns.
- Engine size and drivetrain configuration have a moderate influence on electric and hybrid vehicle range.
- Only 37% of the models qualify for CAFV incentives due to strict tailpipe emission standards.
- Fuel economy for both conventional and alternative fuel vehicles has steadily increased over the past decade.

Market trends indicate a positive shift towards cleaner energy sources with rising fuel economy and electric vehicle adoption.
These findings offer valuable information for stakeholders in the clean energy sector to inform strategic decision-making for future initiatives
